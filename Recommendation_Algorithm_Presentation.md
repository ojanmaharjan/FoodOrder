# Food Recommendation Algorithm: Jaccard Similarity Approach

## 1. Goal
Recommend new food items to a user based on what similar users have ordered.

---

## 2. How It Works

### Step 1: Gather User History
- Collect all food items the current user has ordered in the past.

### Step 2: Compare with Other Users
- For each other user:
  - Gather their ordered food items.
  - Calculate **Jaccard similarity**:
    - Jaccard Similarity = (Foods both users ordered) / (Total unique foods either user ordered)

### Step 3: Find Most Similar Users
- Sort all other users by similarity score.
- Select the top 3 most similar users.

### Step 4: Generate Recommendations
- For these top users:
  - Find foods they ordered that the current user has **not** ordered.
  - These are the recommendations.

### Step 5: Enrich and Sort Recommendations
- Fetch details (price, image, description, category) for each food.
- Sort recommendations by popularity (most ordered globally).

## 3. Special Rules
- **Admin users** do not receive recommendations.
- Only regular users see personalized suggestions.

---

## Summary
- **Collaborative filtering:** Finds users with similar tastes.
- **Jaccard similarity:** Measures overlap in food preferences.
- **Personalized:** Suggests foods you havenâ€™t tried but similar users enjoyed.
- **Dynamic:** Updates as users order new items.
